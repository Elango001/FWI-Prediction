Module 4: Model Training using Ridge Regression
• Trained a Ridge Regression model to handle multicollinearity in input data.
• Tuned the alpha parameter to balance bias-variance tradeoff.
• Evaluated training and validation performance during training.
• Saved the trained model using pickle as ridge.pkl.
• Documented the training process and parameters used.
Module 5: Evaluation and Optimization
• Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
• Computed Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to penalize large errors.
• Calculated R2 Score to assess variance explanation.
• Plotted predicted vs actual values to visualize performance.
• Tuned model parameters (alpha) and retrained if needed to improve metrics.

In a rigde expression I need to see MSE against the  RMSE, MAE  against the different values of alpha

The optimal value of alpha is the one that gives the best train and test accuracy

I want everyone to complete the task by Thursday.

mse_train,
mse_test,

check wheteher it is underfittung or overfitting with rigde regression
